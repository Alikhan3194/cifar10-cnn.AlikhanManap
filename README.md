# Classification of CIFAR-10 Images (via CNN) 

## Project description
This project uses **Svertochnaya neural network (CNN)**, which learns to classify images of the **CIFAR-10** dataset into 10 different categories. The project was created using** TensorFlow + Keras**.

## Results  
 ** Training accuracy: * * 85%  
 ** Test accuracy: * * 78-82%  

## Main features of the project  
 ** 3 convolutional layers (Conv2D)* – - learns features from images  
 ** 3 MaxPooling layers* – - optimizes the model  
 ** Full layer (Dense Layer)* * – classification of classes  
 ** Softmax layer (for Class 10)**  
 ** Training of the model for 20 epochs**  

## Data set (Dataset)  
** CIFAR-10** – 60 000 dataset consisting of an image. Each image is 32×32 pixels.  
The model recognizes the following 10 categories:  
- **Aircraft (airplane)**  
- **CAR (automobile)**  
- **Bird (bird)**  
- **Cat (cat)**  
- **Deer (deer)**  
- **Dog (dog)**  
- **Frog (frog)**  
- **Horse (horse)**  
- **Ship (ship)**  
- **Truck (truck)**
